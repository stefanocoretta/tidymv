This is the repository of the `R` package `tidymv`. This package provides functions for the visualisation of GAM(M)s and the generation of model-based predicted values using tidy tools from the `tidyverse`.

## Installation

The package is on CRAN, so you can install it from there with `install.packages("tidymv")`.

To learn how to use the package, check out the vignettes (for example, `vignette("predict-gam", package = "tidymv")`).

If you wish to install the development version, use `remotes::install_github("stefanocoretta/tidymv@devel", build_vignettes = TRUE)`.
