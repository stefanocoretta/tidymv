## Plotting smooths

To illustrate how to use `plot_smooths()`, let's first prepare some dummy data with a factor variable and run `gam()` on this data. The `gam` model includes a reference smooth `s(x2)`, a by-factor difference smooth `s(x2, by = fac)`, and a smooth `s(x0)`. For more flexibility and for more complex models, using `predict_gam()` and then plotting the predicted data yourself might be helpful (see "predict-gam" vignette).

```{r gam}
set.seed(10)
data <- gamSim(4)
model <- gam(
  y ~
    fac +
    s(x2) +
    s(x2, by = fac) +
    s(x0),
  data = data
)
```

We can now plot the estimated smooths for the two levels of `fac`.
The function supports factors with more than 2 levels.

```{r plot-gam}
plot_smooths(
  model = model,
  series = x2,
  comparison = fac
) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

With models that transform the response scale (like Poisson and binomial models), use the `transform` argument with the function to be used for transformation as the value.
Let's first load some data and fit a Poisson GAM.

```{r pois-gam}
data("pois_df")
pois_gam <- gam(y ~ s(x, by = fac), data = pois_df, family = poisson)
```

We can now plot on the response scale using `transform = exp`.

```{r plot-pois-gam}
plot_smooths(pois_gam, x, fac, transform = exp, series_length = 70) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## Plotting a single smooth

It is also possible to plot a single smooth.

```{r gam-2}
model_2 <- gam(
  y ~
    s(x0) +
    s(x2),
  data = data
)

plot_smooths(
  model = model_2,
  series = x0
)
```

## Plotting interactions

It is possible to plot models with interactions by specifying faceting with the `facet_terms` and `split` arguments.

```{r interaction-data}
data("inter_df")
inter_df <- inter_df %>%
  mutate(
    x1x2 = interaction(x1, x2)
  )

model_inter <- bam(
  y ~
    x1x2 +
    s(x0, k = 8, by = x1x2),
  data = inter_df
)
```

The `split` argument allows the user to split the factor interaction (back) into separate factors, which can be used to facet with the `facet_terms` argument.
`split` takes a named list, where each object in the list is a named vector with the names of the new factors as strings (`c("x1", "x2")`) and the name of the factor interaction to be splitted as the name of this vector (`x1x2 = ...`).

```{r plot-interactions}
plot_smooths(
  model = model_inter,
  series = x0,
  comparison = x1,
  facet_terms = x2,
  split = list(x1x2 = c("x1", "x2"))
) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

You can use the `sep` argument to specify the character used for separating the factor interaction.
By default is `"\\."`, which is the default character used when creating interactions with `interaction()`.

To plot just one or some of the facets, you should use the `conditions` argument.
This argument takes a list of quosures with `quos()`.
The quosures are statements like the ones used in `dplyr::filter()`, and you can include multiple statements separated by commas inside `quos()`.

```{r plot-interactions-2}
plot_smooths(
  model = model_inter,
  series = x0,
  comparison = x1,
  facet_terms = x2,
  conditions = quos(x2 == "b"),
  split = list(x1x2 = c("x1", "x2"))
) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

```{r plot-interactions-3}
plot_smooths(
  model = model_inter,
  series = x0,
  comparison = x1,
  facet_terms = x2,
  conditions = quos(x1 %in% c(1, 3)),
  split = list(x1x2 = c("x1", "x2"))
) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## Plotting the difference smooth

The difference smooth can be plotted with `plot_difference()`.
The difference smooth is the difference between the smooths of two conditions (two levels in a factor).
Portions of the difference smooth confidence interval that do not include 0 are shaded in red.

The following is a difference smooth comparing the two levels of the `fac` term in the poisson GAM above.

```{r plot-diff-model}
plot_difference(
  pois_gam,
  series = x,
  difference = list(fac = c("b", "a"))
)
```

To plot a difference smooth from a model with factor interactions, it is possible to specify the two levels to compare from the factor interaction (the argument `split` is not supported in `plot_difference()`).

```{r plot-diff-inter-1}
plot_difference(
  model_inter,
  x0,
  difference = list(x1x2 = c("2.a", "3.a"))
)
```

```{r plot-diff-inter-3}
plot_difference(
  model_inter,
  x0,
  difference = list(x1x2 = c("1.b", "2.b"))
)
```
