# `tidymv`: Tidy Model Visualisation

This is the repository of the `R` package `tidymv`. This package provides functions for the visualisation of GAM(M)s using tidy tools from the `tidyverse`. `tidymv` is based on the `itsadug` package, and indeed it uses some of its functions under the hood.

## Installation

To install the package, use `devtools::install_github("stefanocoretta/tidymv@v1.4.0", build_vignettes = TRUE)`. To learn how to use the package, do `vignette("plot-smooths", package = "tidymv")` after the installation.
