\title{Plot GLM estimate smooths and difference curve.}
\usage{
plot_gamsd(model, view, comparison, conditions = NULL, rm_re = FALSE,
  bw = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A \code{gam} or \code{bam} model object.}

\item{view}{The predictor determining the time series.}

\item{comparison}{The levels for the comparison as a named list.}

\item{conditions}{The values to use for other predictors as a named list.}

\item{rm_re}{Whether to remove random effects (the default is \code{FALSE}).}

\item{bw}{Whether to plot in black and white (the default is \code{FALSE}).}
}
\description{
It plots comparison smooths from the estimates of a \link[mgcv]{gam} or \link[mgcv]{bam}
and the difference curve. Significant differences are marked with red areas.
